Football Analytics – Pitch Intelligence

Pitch Intelligence is a browser-based football analytics prototype designed to visualize and analyze match events through spatial pitch mapping.

The application focuses on transforming raw football event data into clear, interactive visual insights that highlight how teams and players use space across the pitch. By mapping actions such as passes, shots, and recoveries to specific pitch zones, the tool supports tactical analysis, performance review, and exploratory scouting workflows.
